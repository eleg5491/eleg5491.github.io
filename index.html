Textbooks:

- [Deep Learning.](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) By Ian Goodfellow and it covers most necessities.
- [Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications.](http://szeliski.org/Book/) Most popular among the US. I even bought a hardcopy (cost me too much!) and they have a free e-book online.

- [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/index.htm) Bible in Machine Learning. Everyone should know at least a tiny bit of it. Don't tell others I said you can illegally obtain the electronic verision online.
- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning.](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) Maybe a good choice.
